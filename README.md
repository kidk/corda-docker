## What is Corda?
A distributed ledger made up of mutually distrusting nodes would
allow for a single global database that records the state of deals and obligations
between institutions and people. This would eliminate much of
the manual, time consuming effort currently required to keep disparate
ledgers synchronised with each other. It would also allow for greater levels
of code sharing than presently used in the financial industry, reducing
the cost of financial services for everyone

## Using this image
### Starting up the image
* `docker build -t corda . ` - this will create a base image called "corda"
* `docker run -it --rm --name corda corda ` - this will start up an interactive container using the base image you built

## Child images
If you want to do more with this base image, you will need to add the required corda files. The image expects `/opt/corda/plugins`, `/opt/corda/certificates`, `/opt/corda/logs`, `/opt/corda/corda.jar` and `opt/corda/node.conf`. There are two ways you can reference these files and folders in your image.

### Copying files directly
You can copy the required files across directly into the image from a local directory - see below.

```
FROM bluebankio/corda-docker

# Copying required folders
COPY /plugins/ /opt/corda/plugins
COPY /certificates/ /opt/corda/certificates
COPY /logs/ /opt/corda/logs

# Copying required files
COPY /corda.jar /opt/corda
COPY /node.conf /opt/corda
```
### Mounting a volme
You could also mount a volume that uses a fixed location for the files to be referenced to. For this you will need to state where the volumes will stay, and then reference that location on start - see below.

```
docker build -t corda . 
docker run -it --rm --name corda corda -v plugins:/opt/corda/plugins -v certificates:/opt/corda/certificates -v logs:/opt/corda/logs -v corda.jar:/opt/corda -v node.conf:/opt/corda
```


## Image Variants
